# Inventory-Portfolio
This was a personal project undertaken to learn better ways of Inventory Creation.

## Project Goals
1. Optimise the way items are loaded into the inventory
2. Usage of Sprite Atlas
3. Understand the use of Scriptable Objects and utilise it in an Model View Controller Pattern for the inventory Creation
4. Do two styles of inventory, one that is more simplistic and like a quick prototype and another for a more extensive inventory structure handling much larger item sizes.

## Project Contents
1. UI Frames and sprites were created in Figma for this specific project
2. Item sprites - Kenneys free assets https://www.kenney.nl/assets/page:2?q=2d

## Project Showcase
The following are images from the Unity build as well as the Figma Design creation progress.

### UI Design
In Figma
#### Wireframes
The process of designing the wireframes went through many different iterations and was loosely based on the reference image of the inventory design in Cult of the lamb and Zelda
